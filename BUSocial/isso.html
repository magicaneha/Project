                    <p>
                        <em>Students must be enrolled part-time or full-time in a degree or non-degree program, and the primary activity at BU is to study.</em>
                    </p>
                    <h3>F-1 Student Classification</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most international students at BU are here in this classification, as it is designed to facilitate study toward a specific educational objective. <a href="http://www.bu.edu/isso/immigration-status/immigration-overview/f-1-student-classification/">Click</a> for more information about F-1.

                    <p>
                        If you are currently in the US in another immigration classification, you may be eligible to enroll in either full-time or part-time coursework at BU. <a href="http://www.bu.edu/isso/immigration-status/immigration-overview/other-student-classifications/">Click</a> for more information.

                <div id="imd" style="display: none">
                    <h1 style="text-align: center">Immigration Document</h1>
                    <p>
                        While you are studying or working in the U.S., you should keep your immigration documents safe and valid. It's also important that you understand the purpose of, and validity period for, each document.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Passport</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your passport is an important document issued by your country of citizenship and used to establish your identity. In any correspondence with ISSO and in your BU records and other applications, you should use the name as it appears on your passport. If the information in your passport is not accurate, you must correct it before any other immigration documents are changed.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Validity/Expiration</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's important to Maintain a valid passport which means you maintain your immigration status in the U.S. You'd better make sure that your passport will be valid for as long as possible into the future, but at the minimum, it should always be valid at least six months beyond any anticipated date(s) of entry to the US.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Renewal</h3>
                    <p>
                        If your passport is expiring while you are in the U.S., you will need to take the necessary steps to replace it in a timely manner. You can carry out this process in the U.S. by contacting one of your country's <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/fco/">embassies or consulates</a>, or by returning home and renewing it there. Situation varies from country to country. In some cases, it may be as simple as a trip to your consulate in Boston, but in other cases it may be a more complicated and time-consuming process involving an embassy in Washington, DC, or a consulate in another city.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Corrections</h3>
                    <p>
                        The ISSO needs to use your name, as represented on your passport, on all of your immigration documents. If your passport name is not accurate, you must correct it before any other immigration documents are changed.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Visa</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your visa indicates whether you have permission to enter the U.S. in a certain immigration classification. You may have more than one valid visa in your passport, but you can only have <strong>one</strong> status while you are in the U.S. Therefore, your visa does <strong>not</strong> confirm your current classification or how long you can stay in the U.S.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you are in the U.S., be sure to keep track of your visa's expiration date as it may not coincide with the dates on your other immigration documents. If you plan to travel outside the U.S., you will need a valid visa in order to re-enter. (You can think of your visa as you would a movie ticket: You need it to get into the movie theater, but once you are in the theater, you don't need it unless you exit for some popcorn or snacks. Then if you want to get back in the theater, you need to present that ticket again.)
                    </p>
                    <h3>Expiration and Renewal</h3>
                    <p>
                        If your visa expires when you're in the U.S., you don't need to take any action until the next time you depart the U.S. Then, in most cases, you'll need to obtain a new, valid visa to re-enter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You cannot renew an expired visa from within the U.S., so if you are leaving the US temporarily and your visa is expired, you must make arrangements to obtain a new visa at a U.S. consulate or embassy outside the U.S. Visit our <a href="http://www.bu.edu/isso/travel-visas/">Travel and Visas</a> section for more information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some limited travel abroad may be possible with an expired visa. Please review the information on <a href="http://www.bu.edu/isso/travel-visas/traveltips/">automatic visa revalidation</a>.

Every F-1 student and J-1 exchange visitor has a unique SEVIS record. This record was created by the ISSO prior to issuing your immigration document. You can find your SEVIS number in the upper right corner of your immigration document.

                    <h2>Semester Verification</h2>
                    <p>
                        Federal regulations require BU to notify the Department of Homeland Security about the physical presence and registration of every <a href="http://www.bu.edu/isso/immigration-status/immigration-overview/f-1-student-classification/">F-1</a> student each academic semester. We do this via your electronic SEVIS record once you have verified that you have returned to campus and are registered for a full course of study. <b>F-1 students continuing enrollment at BU must complete F-1 Semester Verification each semester.</b>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Your anticipated completion date can change for many reasons students may change majors or programs, or research can take unexpected (yet exciting) turns. This is normal in academia. If you need additional time to complete your studies or affiliation at BU, the ISSO can advise you on your options and the required paperwork.

                    <p>
                        Your immigration documents should accurately reflect the details of your BU affiliation at all times. Whether you are a student changing education level or degree program, or a scholar whose appointment terms are changing, <b>the ISSO must be notified in advance to assess whether the change will affect your current immigration status.</b>

                    <h1 style="text-align: center">Social Security Number</h1>
                    <p>
                        A Social Security Number (SSN) is a unique identification number that allows the United States government to monitor your taxable wages earned as an employee in the U.S. As an international student or scholar, you only qualify for a Social Security Card if you have authorization to work in the U.S.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The SSN does not give you U.S. employment authorization. It simply provides an identifying number for you to be paid for a U.S. job and for your employer to deduct the appropriate taxes on behalf of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
                    </p>
                    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
                    <p>
                        In order to qualify for a SSN, you must be physically present in the U.S. in an immigration classification that permits employment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Common immigration categories held by Boston University students and scholars include:

                    <h3>F-1 Students</h3>
                    <p>
                        You are eligible to apply for a SSN if you have any of the following types of U.S. work authorizations:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                    <h3>J-1 Students Sponsored by Boston University</h3>
                    <p>
                        You are eligible to apply for an SSN in either of these cases:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If you have been authorized by the ISSO to begin an on-campus job
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you have been granted Academic Training (AT) employment authorization for a job off campus

                    <p>
                        Consult with your J-1 Exchange Program Sponsor to ask about whether you are eligible for U.S. work and about the documentation you will need to apply.

                        You are eligible to apply for your SSN after the validly period of the EAD has begun, and no later than 15 days prior to the expiration of the EAD. (Students in F-1 status, see above.)

                    <h2>Applying for a Social Security Card</h2>
                    <p>
                        You should obtain your Social Security Card before you begin any work in the U.S. If you begin employment without a Social Security Number, you must then inform your employer as soon as you receive your Social Security Number so that they can modify your withholdings for payroll purposes.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Documents for SSN Application</h3>
                    <p>
                        You must present <strong>all</strong> of the following documentation:
                    </p>

                        In most cases, a Social Security Card should be mailed to the address you listed on your application form within 14 business days. If you do not receive a Social Security Card within 30?0 days, you should contact the Social Security Administration via telephone at 800-772-1213 or visit the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/">Social Security Administration</a> website to ask about the status of your pending application.

                    <p>
                        The notation on the Social Security Card should read Valid for Employment Only with DHS Authorization". This clarifies to your employer that the Social Security Card itself does not give you work permission in the U.S. and that you will need to obtain separate work permission in order to start working.

                        As international students and scholars at BU, you must apply for the most appropriate visa that will allow you to enter the US to begin or resume your academic activities. The length of the visa will vary depending on your country of citizenship and your visa classification. The visa must always be valid when entering the US but is allowed to expire after you have entered the country. If you leave the US in the middle of your academic activities and plan to return to BU in the same visa classification to resume the same academic activities, you will need to make certain that your visa is still valid or renew your visa before you return to the US.

                        In order to avoid possible problems in applying for a visa or entering the US, it is recommended that your passport be valid for at least six months beyond your expected entry date to the US.<b></b>

                        The documents that you need to support your visa classification will vary, please see the visa classifications below for specific details. To avoid delays in visa issuance and entering the US, the spelling of your name and your date of birth must be exactly the same as reflected in your passport. If your name or date of birth does not appear correctly on your documents, please notify the ISSO immediately.<br />

The I-20 includes dates and information about your intended program of study. You can find your unique SEVIS ID in the upper-right corner of page 1 of your I-20. If you have dependent family members (husband or wife, children under the age of 21) who will be traveling to the US with you, they will receive their own I-20 Forms to assist with their application(s) for F-2 visa(s).

                        Many students and scholars take the opportunity to travel home or to another country during their time in the US. While you can make plans to depart the US at any time, you need to make certain that you have the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/isso/travel-visas/u-s-re-entry-documentation/">appropriate documentation</a> to return to the US to resume your activities. The information below will help facilitate your return to the US.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Check Your Visa(s)</h2>
                    <p>
                        The visa in your passport does not grant permission to enter a third country (a country that is not the US or your home country). If you are traveling to a third country, you may need a visa to enter that country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You need to contact the embassy or consulate of the country you will be traveling to and ask for specific information about visa requirements for citizens from your home country since the ISSO can only advise on re-entry to the US.

                    <p>
                        F and J nonimmigrants who travel to Canada, Mexico, or the adjacent islands (except for Cuba) may return to the US using an <em>expired</em> US visa. This rule is known as Automatic Visa Revalidation. To successfully use Automatic Visa Revalidation, travelers must have previously entered the US in a nonimmigrant visa category, and must be maintaining valid nonimmigrant status.

                    <p>
                        For all other visa categories, Automatic Visa Revalidation does not apply. All other visa categories must have a <em>valid and current</em> US visa stamp in order to re-enter the US.
                    </p>
                    <p>
