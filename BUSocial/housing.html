            <h1> Our Residences </h1>
        <p> Visit our residences pages to see our diverse accommodations, building descriptions and specialty residences. We also have campus maps to view the locations of all our residences.Residence accommodations on campus include dormitory-style, apartment-style, large residences, and small brownstones.
        Most residences are coeducational.  Men and women are housed in the same residence or on the same floor in separate sections or units with separate bath facilities. There are some residences exclusively for men or women, as well as male and female floors or floor sections in the larger residences.</p><br>

            <p>Living on campus is the best way to become involved at Boston University, to make new friends, to be challenged in your academic pursuits and to share your ideas and further your goals.

There are ten dormitory-style residences, each accommodating a large number of students. These range from Danielsen Hall with 280 students, to the West Campus area with over 1,800 students. Most residences are coeducational. In most cases, men and women are housed in separate sections of the same floor with separate bath facilities or on separate floors within the residence.

The large dormitory-style residences have around-the-clock security staff at the front entrance to monitor building access.

A variety of services and resources are available in the larger dormitory-style residences. Each residence is unique, and all provide students with endless opportunities for involvement in campus activities.Boston University maintains a number of apartment-style residences for our students.  While the majority of these are in the South Campus area, along Buswell Street, Arundel Street, Mountfort Street, St. Mary’s Street, and Park Drive, there are apartment-style residences in Student Village, on Bay State Road and on Commonwealth Avenue as well.</p>

            <b>Students Continuing for the Fall Semester</b> 
            
            <p>After their first year in residence, undergraduate students who live on campus and desire on-campus housing for the next academic year complete the Continuing Student Housing Application. Students who complete their application (electronically sign their Residence License Agreement and submit their $600 nonrefundable housing guarantee payment using a credit card or a U.S. bank account) by the announced deadline may participate in the spring room selection process. Students may request the rooms they occupy in the current semester or, based upon available spaces, may request another residence, room/apartment, and roommate. Students receive an e-mail from BU Housing in early February with information about the Continuing Student Housing Application and the spring room selection process.

Students are guaranteed housing for their entire undergraduate experience as long as their stays in on-campus housing are continuous. If students elect to move off campus and later decide they would like to live on campus, they must apply for on-campus housing. Once students leave on-campus housing, there is no guarantee that they will be provided on-campus housing in the future.<br> </p>
            
            <b>Students Returning for the Spring Semester</b><p>
            
            Students returning for the spring semester will complete a Spring Only Housing Application and will be assigned based on space availability (vacancies that result from students who go away on study abroad or internship programs, graduate, or withdraw or take leaves of absence from the University) and the information provided in their applications. Residence assignments are made over the Winter Break and will be available on the Student Link in January, just prior to the opening of residences for the spring semester.

                <p>  <b>Move In</b> : - When you arrive on campus, check in at the residence office for your assigned residence.

You will be given, and asked to sign for, the keys to your residence. You will also be asked to complete a hall registration card and to provide emergency contact information.

Students must be registered and have settled their University student accounts before they will be issued residence keys.

If you plan to arrive after the first day of classes, you must notify BU Housing.

If you plan to ship personal belongings (or your family plans to send you packages), mail or ship these items to arrive on or after the day you are scheduled to move in. You should travel to campus with the essential items you will need during your first few days on campus.

Read about furnishings, mail rooms, telephones, and more in Safety & Services. If you need a packing checklist, please review our What to Bring webpage for suggestions.

Upon check-in, you will be asked to complete a room condition report in order to assess the condition of your room assignment.  Students should indicate any problems with the room or apartment and return it to your resident assistant by the designated date. Together, the student and the resident assistant will check for accuracy and both will sign the form indicating agreement with the documented condition of the room.  You must complete this process at your new residence any time you change on-campus residences during the year. The room condition report is the primary reference used when billing students for damages. To be valid, it must be signed by your resident assistant. </p>    
<br><p><b>Move Out</b>  : - You are responsible for turning in your keys to your residence office whenever you move out of a residence, or if you move from one residence to another during the year.

If you move out of your residence at any time during the year, for example, to change rooms or to withdraw, it is your responsibility to obtain a Check-out Room Condition Report. You must complete this report with your resident assistant and submit the completed form to your residence office. (Room condition reports are not completed during the end-of-the-academic-year move-out process.)

Please remove all of your belongings, and leave the room or apartment in a clean and habitable condition. All furniture that was in your room when you moved in is expected to be there and arranged as you found it. If you fail to properly check out and turn in your keys, you may be charged additional residence, dining plan, and lock/key fees.

When moving, always remember to complete a mail forwarding change-of-address card so that your mail can be forwarded. Complete a change-of-address card at the residence mail room where you receive your mail, or through the Kenmore Station Post Office at 11 Deerfield Street, if you receive mail via street delivery.</p></div>
